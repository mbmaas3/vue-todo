# vue-todo
A starter project for building a responsive ToDo list app using Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia. The core setup is done, so you can focus on development and showcasing your skills.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later) or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install

4. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev

### The Task

- **Create and implement a ToDo list** that allows users to:
    - Add new tasks
    - Remove tasks
    - Mark tasks as completed
- **Ensure the application is responsive** and works well on both desktop and mobile.
- **Style the application** using Tailwind CSS.
- **Use TypeScript** to define types for the tasks (e.g., Todo interface) and ensure type-safety in functions.
- **Manage state** using Pinia for storing and updating ToDo items.
